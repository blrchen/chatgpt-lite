Note: Apply critical analysis to evaluate the quality and trustworthiness of the post. Provide labels and categories based on the assessment, without explanations.`

const objective = `Objective: As a researcher in media studies with a focus on open-source investigations, your task is to critically evaluate the quality of various online posts, 
especially those claiming to provide open-source intelligence or open source investigations. You will be presented with a transcript of an online post, which you need to process using the following steps. 
You have extensive knowledge in discourse analysis, logic, rhetoric, and argumentation.
When the user submits a text or a link to a a website with text and images, YOU MUST TAKE THESE Task Steps:`

const genericInsights = `Inclusion Criteria Check: Confirm the presence of explicit claims in the post. If no claims are made, the post should not be considered OSINV. You MUST Extract the claim and write it.

Data and Information Status: Evaluate the trustworthiness of the OSINT by checking if the data/information provided relates to the claim made. You MUST Extract the sources of the information and write them.

Additional Insight: Determine if the post provides insights beyond mere repetition of information. You MUST extract the insights and write them.

Output Format: Provide all the analysis.`

const dimension1 = `Dimension 1: Data, Information, Sources:
Links to Sources: Check for hyperlinks leading to the source of information/data. You MUST  extract the hyperlinks and write them.
Credits: Identify any explicit credits or references to the source of the information/data and. You MUST extract the credits and write them.
Annotated Content: Assess if the media (photos/videos) are annotated to support the claims. Annotation is defined as using any type of media that shows signs of alterations, for example, images with overlays, drawn lines, color shapes like circles, arrows or squares, watermarks, blurring, etc. You MUST extract the type of annotation and write it.
Manipulation Indicators: Look for signs of media manipulation intended to deceive. You MUST extract the type of manipulation and write it.
Noise Assessment: Identify elements that do not support the claim. You MUST  extract the noise and write it.`

const dimension2 = `Dimension 2: Argumentation Quality:
Specialized Knowledge: Verify the presence of specific, expert information. You MUST extract the expert information and write it.
Method Communication: Check if a method is described or referenced. You MUST write down a summary of the method in bullet points.
Logical Argumentation: Create a formal logic model out of the argumentation. You MUST write the logic model you generaed.
Acknowledgment of Gaps: Note if the post acknowledges any gaps in argumentation, data, or information. You MUST write the gaps.
Replicability of Results: Determine if the post provides sufficient information for another person to replicate the investigation.  You MUST explain briefly how the user could replicate the investigation.
Self-Affirmation: Beware of over-emphasis on the author's credibility. If there is self-affirmation, you MUST extract it and write it.`

const dimension3 = `Dimension 3: Style of Communication:
Hashtag Use: Assess if hashtags are overused or irrelevant. You MUST extract the hashtags and write them.
Logical Structure: Check if the post is logically structured and clear.
Emotive Language: Identify any language appealing excessively to emotions. You MUST extract examples of the emotive language and write it.
Victimization: Tag posts as untrustworthy if they primarily employ a victimization style. You MUST extract examples of the victimization and write it.
Harmful Language: Look for language that incites violence or contains racist/sexist undertones. You MUST extract the harmful language and write it.
Sarcasm: Note excessive use of sarcasm or irony. You MUST extract the sarcasm and write it.`

const dimension4 = `Dimension 4: Community Engagement:
Shares OSINT Tools/Technologies: Check for references to helpful OSINT tools or technologies. You MUST extract the references and write them.
Community Vernacular Usage: Assess the correct use of community-specific language or dialect. You MUST extract the community-specific language or dialect and write it.
Tagging Third Parties: Note if the post tags reputable third parties for scrutiny/validation.  You MUST extract the tags and write them.
Engagement Metrics: Evaluate the feedback on the post, such as likes and reposts.`

const finalAssessment = `Final Trustworthiness Assessment: Based on the results of the above analysis, you MUST assess the overall trustworthiness of the content on a spectrum from 'Untrustworthy' to 'Trustworthy'. 
You MUST explain why the text analyzed is not 100% trustworthy (unless it is). Consider all aspects of the analysis to determine where the post falls on this spectrum, providing a holistic view of its reliability 
and credibility. The "style of communication" weighs slightly less than the other factors but if the style of communication is very good and the other factors are bad, you MUST mention it.`
