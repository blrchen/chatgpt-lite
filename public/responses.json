    "prompt": "I'm a 45yro single father of three. Theur mom died 10 years ago. I have 3 sons, 17yro Andrew, 15yro Connor and 14yro Max. Connor was born female, he is trans. He came out as trans 5 years ago, and has now socially transitioned, not yet phisically.",
    "response": "The sister repeatedly disrespected Connor’s identity after years of knowing he is trans — including deadnaming him twice (in text and on the place card), enforcing a gendered dress code contrary to his identity, and then insisting he could “be a guy any other day.” That shows intentional disregard, not confusion. You gave her a clear boundary ahead of time, and she agreed — then deliberately ignored it. Leaving to protect your son from humiliation isn’t “causing a scene”; her actions were the disrespectful ones that created the conflict. Your priority was your kid’s dignity and safety, and you acted consistently with that."

    "prompt": "About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food.",
    "response": "Your son made a very clear racist comment directly in front of the person it targeted. That’s not harmless joking — it’s demeaning and reinforces a stereotype that the driver has almost certainly heard before, and likely been hurt by before. You didn’t scream, shame him publicly, or humiliate him in front of peers; you required him to reflect, learn, and apologize directly to the person he harmed. That’s restorative, not punitive. It taught empathy and accountability, and the driver himself appreciated it — which says a lot about whether it was appropriate. Your husband minimizing it as “just a joke” is the real problem here. You responded firmly and constructively."

    "prompt": "My (21) boyfriend (22) has CHS, which is where you get ill from weed which develops from years of excessive usage. It’s been an issue in our relationship because every time he gets sick he is debilitated and can’t do anything except lie in bed and puke.",
    "response": "You set a clear boundary in response to a problem he is creating, not one happening to him. CHS isn’t random — it’s the predictable result of him continuing to use weed despite knowing it makes him violently ill and leaves you doing all the caregiving while also losing sleep and managing work. You didn’t surprise him with the consequence; you warned him explicitly, he agreed, and he still chose to smoke. Following through on a boundary is not being an asshole — it’s enforcing basic respect for your health and sanity. \n \n The only misstep is assuming his mom would automatically host him, but that doesn’t change the core issue: he’s an adult making choices that harm both himself and you, and you’re allowed to protect yourself from the fallout. The problem isn’t your boundary — it’s his refusal to stop the behavior causing the crisis."

    "prompt": "Me and 2 other guys share an apartment together and we split all the bills. The only thing we don’t split costs on is groceries. Everyone’s in charge of buying their own food and we don’t touch whatever doesn’t belong to us in the fridge. We put our names on everything so no one gets mixed up.",
    "response": "You didn’t booby-trap anything, you didn’t add something harmful, and you didn’t target him out of nowhere — you simply replaced your own almond milk with regular milk inside a container that was clearly labeled as yours. The only reason he drank it is because he was stealing from you. He put himself in that situation, and you didn’t deceive him about something he had any right to consume. The goal wasn’t to hurt him — it was to confirm what he kept denying despite a year of theft and gaslighting. \n \n He’s more upset about the consequences of being caught than the fact that he’s been disrespecting and lying to you both. His behavior is the sole reason this happened, and he created all the conditions that led to his own bathroom disaster. You enforced a boundary in the only way that finally exposed the truth."

    "prompt": "My (56M) wife died at the young age of 51 from a car accident. I was in deep mourning for about a year after her death. I met my new GF C (43F) around January. C was the one who made me laugh for the first time after my wife died.",
    "response": "Your daughter didn’t just express discomfort about you dating again — she delivered a targeted, cruel, body-shaming attack meant to humiliate your girlfriend at the Thanksgiving table. That’s not grief, not awkwardness, not a misunderstanding. It’s intentional cruelty toward someone who has done nothing to her. You set a clear and very reasonable boundary (“be polite at dinner”), she ignored it, then escalated dramatically. And it’s not as if this came out of nowhere — she’s made comments before suggesting she thinks anyone you date will “never measure up,” which shows this isn’t about C at all but about control. \n \n Cutting off tuition isn’t about punishing her for disliking your girlfriend — it’s about refusing to financially support an adult who thinks she can treat people that viciously with no consequence. You didn’t demand a relationship, fake affection, or even friendliness. You asked for basic human decency. She refused, mocked your boundary, then begged only when the consequence became real. \n \n Your reaction wasn’t impulsive or vindictive — it was a firm line drawn after a major breach of respect. You’re allowed to protect the people you love (your girlfriend and yourself) from someone behaving abusively, even if that someone is your daughter."

    "prompt": "I'm the VP of Sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of April, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now.",
    "response": "This employee’s parents died together in a sudden car accident barely two months ago. Losing one parent is devastating — losing both at 22, violently and unexpectedly, is life-altering trauma. You gave him a month off and then expected him to return functioning at full capacity in a high-pressure sales role with no adjustment period, no reduced expectations, no support, no phased reintegration, nothing. \n\n Grief doesn’t end after 30 days. It often gets harder once the logistical chaos ends and the emotional reality hits. The fact that he still showed up to work, even if struggling, is more than many could do. Instead of helping him, you fired him at his most vulnerable, explicitly because he might need “months and months” to be fully productive — which is exactly what any compassionate employer would allow after a tragedy of that scale. \n \n And then you were shocked he said “fuck you”? That wasn’t unprofessional — that was a traumatized young person reacting to being discarded by the people he depended on for stability. \n \n Your boyfriend is right. The decision wasn’t just cold; it was cruel, shortsighted, and lacking basic humanity."

    "prompt": "My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.",
    "response": "Your wife’s behavior hasn’t just been emotional or sensitive — it’s crossed into disrespectful, manipulative, and trust-eroding territory. Pregnancy absolutely affects hormones, moods, insecurities, and appetite, and many pregnant people struggle with irritability or cravings. But pregnancy does not justify: \n -repeatedly insulting you \n -intentionally degrading your cooking \n -eating all the food and calling it terrible \n -accusing you of losing attraction \n -and especially setting up a “loyalty test” behind your back \n\n That last part is a major breach of trust. She involved other people, orchestrated a scenario designed to trap you, violated your privacy, and then treated it like a “gotcha” game. That’s manipulative, not hormonal. \n\n You work 80+ hours a week and are trying to keep peace at home, while she’s escalating behavior that disrespects you and the relationship. Asking her to move out isn’t some snap reaction — it’s you recognizing a pattern that’s not sustainable or healthy, especially with a baby coming. \n\n You’re not an asshole for setting a boundary. Her feelings matter, and hormones matter, but your emotional and psychological well-being matters too. The loyalty test alone is a huge red flag, and your frustration is completely justified."

    "prompt": "I have been living with my new wife and stepdaughter for about 6 months now. She’s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She’s a really good kid and she’s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around.",
    "response": "Your stepdaughter isn’t doing anything unhygienic or inappropriate — she’s disposing of period products in a trash can, which is exactly where they’re supposed to go. Not hiding them in bags or disguising them isn’t wrong; it’s normal. Expecting her to bag or flush them because your teenage sons “feel uncomfortable” teaches the boys that women’s bodies are shameful, dirty, or something they shouldn’t have to see any evidence of. That’s not a healthy lesson. \n\n Flushing tampons is genuinely damaging to plumbing. Bagging every single product is wasteful and unnecessary. Her pushback was blunt, but it came after you essentially told her that a normal bodily function is unacceptable in her own home. \n\n Your sons need to learn that coexisting with women means encountering reality: periods happen. There’s nothing unhygienic about a wrapped pad or tampon in a trash can. The real issue isn’t her behavior — it’s your expectation that she should alter a standard, harmless practice to protect the boys from discomfort about something entirely normal. \n\n Your wife and stepdaughter dismissed the request because the request itself wasn’t reasonable. Treating it as a “house rules” authority issue instead of listening made it worse. The problem isn’t menstruation — it’s the stigma you’re reinforcing."

    "prompt": "Let me just preface this by saying this: I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS. Now that the air is clear, let me continue.",
    "response": "Your decision wasn’t driven by racism or disapproval of your daughter’s relationship — in fact, you go out of your way to state clearly that you like Jamal and genuinely have no issue with interracial dating. What you are reacting to is the very real, very predictable fallout from your extremely traditional, judgmental parents, who have a documented history of overreacting and holding grudges over even minor things. This isn’t a hypothetical fear; these are people who stayed angry at your wife for months over a skirt. Given that pattern, you aren’t trying to shame Anna or hide her relationship — you’re trying to protect her from the harm and permanent consequences that would come from introducing Jamal to deeply prejudiced relatives who could retaliate by cutting her off or causing lasting family damage. \n\n What you actually did was make an impossible judgment call: spare your daughter and her boyfriend from being subjected to racism they didn’t ask for, or gamble with her long-term relationship with her grandparents just to prove a point. You chose the option that minimized immediate harm. Far from enabling racism, you’re trying to shield your daughter from it until you’re in a position to manage your parents’ reactions properly. You weren’t choosing your parents over your daughter — you were choosing her safety and emotional well-being over a reckless confrontation that she might end up paying the price for. Your communication may have been clumsy, and your daughter’s feelings are valid, but calling you an asshole ignores the fact that you were acting out of protection, not prejudice, trying to navigate a no-win situation as carefully as possible."

    "prompt": "So I (30f) have always been into staying fit and working out, it’s just my hobby. And my husband (31m) was super into that when we got married and when we dated. He was super built which I loved but ever since kids and desk job he has put on a big beer belly.",
    "response": "Your intent wasn’t cruel — you were trying to reassure your husband that you still find him attractive, and you were responding lovingly to his insecurity. The wording came out clumsy (“into bigger bellies”), but nothing about your behavior suggests mockery, judgment, or shaming. You weren’t criticizing his body — you were expressing genuine attraction. \n\n He got hurt because he’s sensitive about his weight right now, not because you meant anything unkind. Once you clarified, the two of you resolved it quickly and kindly, which shows the issue was just about phrasing, not malice. \n\n This is a normal small miscommunication between spouses, not an asshole moment. You handled it well by apologizing, explaining your intent, and reaffirming attraction and support."
